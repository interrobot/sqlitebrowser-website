Thanks to new team member Nikolay Zlatev, an AppImage of our recent 3.12.2 release is available:

* https://download.sqlitebrowser.org/DB_Browser_for_SQLite-v3.12.2-x86_64.AppImage
  * ea14c7439f7e666f3e9d8cbffe9048134b87db3e2d7bf65f4146b0649536de5c (SHA256 checksum)

That should work on most Linux (x86_64) distributions, and should help people running
older software to use our new releases.

Good stuff Nikolay! :grinning:
