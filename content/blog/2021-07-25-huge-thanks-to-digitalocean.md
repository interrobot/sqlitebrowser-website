A huge shout out and thanks to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)
for hosting our entire Infrastructure, 100% free! :man_dancing:

We've been with them for over a year now, and have a bunch of servers.  In
that time, we've experienced _no_ outages or weirdness whatsoever.  It's been
fantastic!

If you're looking for a good, reliable Cloud service that doesn't suffer
from network weirdness or outages, DigitalOcean is a solid choice. :smile:
