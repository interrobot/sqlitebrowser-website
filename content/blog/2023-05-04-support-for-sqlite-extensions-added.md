On [DBHub.io](https://dbhub.io), we've just rolled out support for these
extensions, for all database types:

   * [FTS3 & FTS3_PARENTHESIS](https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html)
   * [FTS5](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html)
   * [GEOPOLY](https://www.sqlite.org/geopoly.html)
   * [JSON1](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html)
   * [MATH_FUNCTIONS](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_mathfunc.html)
   * [RTREE](https://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html)
   * [SOUNDEX](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#soundex)

This means your databases are now able to use all of the functions provided
by these extensions, which should be very useful for a lot of people.
