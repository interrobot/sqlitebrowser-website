Thanks to the excellent effort of [@LeMoussel](https://github.com/LeMoussel),
there is now a Python library for people to use and access their SQLite databases
on DBHub.io. :smile:

It's called [pydbhub](https://github.com/LeMoussel), and is available here:

https://github.com/LeMoussel/pydbhub

And on PyPi:

https://pypi.org/project/pydbhub/
