Thanks to the excellent effort of [@LeMoussel](https://github.com/LeMoussel),
there is now a Python library for people to use and access their SQLite databases
on DBHub.io.

It's called [pydbhub](https://github.com/LeMoussel), and is available here:

https://github.com/LeMoussel/pydbhub

It should be on PyPi in the reasonably near future as well. :smile:
