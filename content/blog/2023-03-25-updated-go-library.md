Following the news that [databases can now be updated via the API](/blog/live-databases-are-now-live), we have updated the Go library which accesses and queries your databases on DBHub.io to v0.1.0 to also use these new live features.  You can easily send INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE queries without sending base64 encoded SQL queries via the API.

You can see the initial blog post for the Go library [here ](/blog/new-go-library-for-working-with-your-dbhub-io-databases/).
