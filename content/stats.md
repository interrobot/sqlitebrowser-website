# Monthly downloads

<p align="center">
<p>
These Monthly Download stats begin in August 2018, when we moved our primary
download location from GitHub to our own servers.

<p>
GitHub does make download stats available through their API, and it would be
useful to add the historical (and ongoing) downloads from GitHub to this too.
Some day. :smile:

The missing chunk of download numbers around the start of 2021, was when the
download servers weren't saving the download info in the backend database
properly. ðŸ¤¦


# Monthly active users - non version specific count

This "Monthly Active Users" graph just shows a simple count of how many unique
IP addresses (per month) are checking whether a newer version of DB Browser for
SQLite is available.

Prior to our 3.11.0 release, this check was done by querying our repository on
GitHub.

Due the acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft, we've changed this version query to
ask our download servers instead.

The graph begins in August of 2018, when this "where to query the latest
version" change was made.  The code appeared first in our [nightly builds for
windows and macOS](https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest), and is shown in
the first few weeks of graph numbers.

The numbers noticeably increase in October 2018, with our [first Alpha release
for 3.11.0](https://sqlitebrowser.org/blog/first-alpha-release-for-3-11-0/).

With the [3.11.0 release](https://sqlitebrowser.org/blog/version-3-11-0-released/)
in Feb 2019, we again see an increase.  That release had a critical bug, so was
quickly pulled (as seen in the graph above).

The [3.11.1 release](https://sqlitebrowser.org/blog/version-3-11-1-released/)
roughly a week and a half later is where we start to see meaningful numbers.

# Monthly active users - version specific count

This graph shows similar information to the one above, but this time includes
the version number.

The total number of "active users" in any given month can be slightly higher
than the graph above (and therefore less accurate), as this one includes an
entry for each version of DB Browser for SQLite launched.

For example, when someone  launches an older version of DB Browser for SQLite
it will count them for that version, and then count them again if they upgrade
to a newer version.
